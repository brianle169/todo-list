# To-Dojo

# Overview

Todo-list is a staple in software development projects for beginners. This is because it is easy enough to be made in a short amount of time, while being challenging enough to force us to think and search up for information regularly (at least for me that was the case).\

# Purpose

The intention of this project was not to show off my skills in programming, but to act as a challenging practice project to improve my knowledge and skills in working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.\

The objective of To-Dojo is to allow me to practice the following skills/technology:

- DOM Manipulation with events
- Designing & dividing a big program into smaller integrative modules (this skill needs extra improvement)
- Using `import` and `export` feature to integrate modules together
- JavaScript Objects creation methods (classes, factory functions, modules, etc.) and how to work with Objects
- Using Webpack to synchronize and manage external packages for development, and also to allow the app to run well on other machines (new skill)
- Basic usage of `date-fns` package for date formatting (new skill)
- Using `localStorage` to keep data records locally and display on app load (new skill)
- Developing also for mobile/small-screen layout
- Problem solving, JS array methods, etc.
